set = {3,3,3,4,5,6,4,4,4,5,6,"hello","world","hello"}
print(set)
# the motive of using the set is , it only includes unique values in it...
# and does not allows repitiion of values 

# there are 2 imp methods i thought would be crucial
set1 = {2,4,6,8}
set2 = {4,8,12,16}
print(set1.union(set2))
print(set1.intersection(set2))
 # now u got it right?
